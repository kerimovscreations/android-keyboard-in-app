## üîí Purpose

This project provides a custom keyboard solution that prioritizes security and privacy:

- **Anti-Keylogging Protection**: Prevents malicious third-party keyboards from capturing sensitive user input
- **Zero Trust Approach**: Eliminates dependency on external keyboard applications that may compromise user data
- **In-App Security**: Keeps all input processing within the application boundary
- **Privacy-First Design**: Ensures sensitive information like passwords, PINs, and personal data never leave the app context

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android SDK API level 24 or higher
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Gradle 8.0+

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash

   cd android-keyboard-in-app
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to the project directory and open it

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

- **Russian (RU)**: Cyrillic keyboard layout

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Core Security Implementations

1. **Disabled Ripple Effects**:
   - All keyboard keys have ripple effects disabled (`indication = null`)
   - Prevents visual feedback that could be exploited for input monitoring
   - Implemented in `KeyButton` component with `MutableInteractionSource()`

2. **System Keyboard Interception**:
   - Uses `InterceptPlatformTextInput` to completely disable system keyboard
   - Implemented in `DisableSoftKeyboard` composable
   - Ensures no external keyboard can capture input

3. **Haptic Feedback Control**:
   - Controlled haptic feedback using `HapticFeedbackConstants.KEYBOARD_TAP`
   - Provides user feedback without compromising security

4. **Memory Security**:
   - Input handling through `TextFieldValue` with controlled text processing
   - Immediate text processing without external clipboard exposure
   - Secure backspace and text selection handling

5. **Visual Security**:
   - Custom styled keys with controlled visual feedback
   - No external theme dependencies that could be compromised
   - Consistent UI that cannot be mimicked by malicious keyboards

### Input Protection Features

- **Clipboard Security**: Controlled clipboard access with custom `WithClipboardText` component
- **Focus Management**: Secure focus handling to prevent input interception
- **Text Selection**: Protected text selection and editing operations
- **Backspace Security**: Secure character deletion with long-press clear functionality

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Components

- **`InAppKeyboard`**: Main keyboard component with full input handling
- **`KeyboardLayout`**: Layout manager for different keyboard types
- **`TextKeyboard`**: Text input keyboard with multi-language support
- **`NumberKeyboard`**: Numeric input keyboards for different number types
- **`DisableSoftKeyboard`**: Security component to disable system keyboard
- **`KeyButton`**: Secure key component with disabled ripple effects

### Architecture

The keyboard is built using a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Security layer (input interception and protection)
- UI layer (Compose-based keyboard components)
- Input handling layer (text processing and cursor management)
- Language support layer (multi-language character sets)
